# What Do We Eat for Dinner?
I don't know, what do we want to eat? A logic game of meta proportions, help you and your roommates decide what food you guys want to eat. But, just like in real life, it might take a while for everyone to agree...

<i>What Do We Eat for Dinner?</i> was created for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/what-do-we-eat-dinner">Global Game Jam 2015</a> by a two-person team: Phyllis Douglas and Andrew Elliott. We used the <a href="http://www.love2d.org">LOVE 2D engine</a>. This is the new repository for the source code - we had previously used Google Code, but it shut down :(

The music used can be found here: <a href="http://www.bensound.com">http://www.bensound.com</a>

If you want to know more about the game, please tweet Phyllis (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/goofanader">@goofanader</a>) or email her at phyllis_1510@msn.com about the problems/etc.

Thanks for checking out the source code!
